# Git-Jass

Git Jass is a Training Coding Project by adridoss91 during the computer science career path on Codecademy.
The game is based on the traditional Swiss card game called "Jassen". Two player opposite each other form a team and play against the other two people.
There are many different modi to play this game. For this exercise I chose the most basic modus called "Obenabe" meaning from top to bottom. In this modus, the higher card of the right color, beats the other cards.

If you want to know more about the game, please visit Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jass

There are still some kinks to sort out or some functionality to improve.

Thank you very much for your interest.
